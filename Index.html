            This is the result of only 3 days worth of trying to teach myself HTML, CSS, and Java Script.<br>
            My head is killing me lol! But, considering I have managed to get this far in so little time, I would say that it was worth the headache so far.<br>
            As you can tell by simply exploring the page, I have not accomplished much.<br>
            But, if all of the YouTube influencers are to be believed, everything that I have figured out is part of learning, and I will <br> likely start a more daunting task like 
            creating external CSS files next. <br> A quick inspection of this page will likely make you lauhg at how pathetic the composition is, or vomit out of shear digust for how terrible it is.<br>
            With that being said, thanks for stopping by. I have no way of knowing if you did, but it's the thought that counts right?<br></p>
